<p align="center"><strong>A simple Pong game built with HTML Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS</strong></p>

---

This is a basic Pong game I created as a mini-project to experiment with the HTML `<canvas>` element and practice some JavaScript.  

- There are currently some bugs with the main game collisions, especially when the ball hits either the top or bottom part of the paddle for both the player and the computer.

- It is also not optimized for devices without a mouse input as it is required for the paddle movement, without a keyboard functionalities like pausing and restarting won't work
